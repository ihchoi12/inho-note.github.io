## Common:
- Form a contract that any subclasses which inherits from them **have to implement their abstract methods** (i.e., methods w/o body). 
- Cannot be instantiated as itself

## Difference:
##### Abstract Class: \
- *extends*
- (usually) Contains at least one abstract method
- Possible to have no methods (reason: to prevent it from being instantiated on its own)
- When to use? To define superclass with some common methods (general methods) for all subclasses 
while giving some flexibilities of some methods' (abstrace methods) body to subclasses  

##### Interface: \
- *implements*
- Contains only abstract methods
- When to use? When we have multiple subclasses having methods with common interface (name, parameter) yet unique body only.
