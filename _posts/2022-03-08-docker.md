# Docker
- tool for running apps in an isolated environment
- similar as running apps in a VM (consistent environment regardless of the externel changes, sandbox different projects, portability)
- but docker is simpler than VM

## Docker VS VM
- Various linux distributions (ubuntu, mint, ...) implement different application layers on top of the same linux kernel layer
- Both Docker and VM are virtualization tool
- then, which parts of OS they virtualize?
- Docker: virtualizes application layer and uses the kernel of host (doesn't have it's own kernel)
- VM: has application layer and it's own kernel (virtualizes the complete OS), doesn't use host kernel
- docker container is 
  * much smaller
  * running faster: no need to load the OS kernel 
  * not compatible with different host kernel (cannot run linux based container on Windows), workaround: Docker Toolbox

## Install Docker on Linux
- Follow the docker docs official page (normally docker CE is enough)


## Docker File
- text file with a list of steps to perform to create an Image
- define an Image
- ex. configure OS => install some SW => copy project files => ..
- the name must be Dockerfile
#### Docker File Structure
- FROM IMG
  * base image
- ENV ENV_VAR_NAME1=VAL1 ENV_VAR_NAME2=VAL2 ... 
  * optionally define environment variables 
  * it's better to do it externally in a Docker Compose file 
  * why? if some env var changed, can override, instead of rebuilding image
- RUN CMD
  * execute any linux commands **inside** the container of this image
- COPY HOST_PATH CONT_PATH
  * copy all files on HOST_PATH of host to CONT_PATH on the container
- CMD \[cmd_chunk_1, cmd_chunk_2, ...\]
  * execute an entry point linux command
- WORKDIR PATH
  * set the PATH as the current working directory
  * commands onwards are executed at PATH



## Image
- a way to package application with all necessary dependencies and configuration
- portable artifact (easily shared and moved around)
- obtained by building a docker file: a file containing layers of OS, software, application image layers
- typically form a stack (layers) of images (linux + app + ...)
- mostly, the base layer is Linux (alpine) for small size
- so, some commands (e.g., only in Ubuntu) may not be usable by default
 

## Container
- obtained by running an Image
- It's a running instance of Image
- A VM gets it's own full OS including kernel via the hypervisor, which uses quite many host resources 
- But container shares the OS with host (but everything on top of that is separated)
- a container is binded to a port which allows talking to application inside it
- has a virtual file system
- In docker, codes and environments are all wrapped inside a container 
- a container is stopped once the main process is stopped, so we should run one process in one container
- once a container is restarted, all previous state of the container is gone
- so, we use Volume to make data persistent

### Container repository
- a storage of containers
  * private repository
  * publick repository for docker (DockerHub)

## Docker Volume
- to share or persist data between containers (or host)
- we can mount a host dir into the VFS of a container
- then, the volume is used as a shared folder between a container and host

## Container Ports
- different containers can use the same port at the same time
- we can check the port of each container by *docker ps*
- we bind a port on host to a container's port
- we can access to a container from host via the binded port

## Docker Network
- docker can create an isolated docker network within the host
- containers are running inside it, talking to each other using only container names (w/o localhost:port etc.)
- application running on the host connects to containers in docker network using localhost:port

## Docker Compose
- a structured way to configure docker containers to run
- to make a blueprint to run multiple containers 
- Docker Compose creates a network for the containers it runs (we don't need to create and specify the network)
- keyworks:
  * version: version of docker compose
  * services: list of containers to run

## Commands
- docker build -t NAME:TAG LOCATION_OF_Dockerfile
  * to build an image from a Dockerfile
  * the image name and tag (version) will be NAME:TAG 
  * LOCATION_OF_Dockerfile does not include Dockerfile (since the name is always Dockerfile)
- docker pull IMGNAME
  * pull imgage IMGNAME
  * can see many lines of HASH: Downloading ... 
  * each line is one image (form layers altogether)
  * when pulling, existing image layers will not be downloaded again
- docker images
  * check all existing images
- docker run IMGNAME:TAG
  * run image IMGNAME:TAG into a container
  * in attached mode (ctrl+c to exit and terminate the container) 
  * if IMGNAME:TAG doesn't exist on local, pull it from DockerHub then run
  * -d // run in detached mode (will output the container ID)
  * -pHOST_PORT:CONT_PORT // run the container listening to CONT_PORT and bind it to HOST_PORT 
  * --name NAME // to specify container name
  * -e ENV_VAR_NAME=VAL // to specify an environemt variable value
  * --net NET_NAME // to specify the docker network to run this container in
  * -v HOST_PATH:CONT_PATH // mount HOST_PATH to CONT_PATH
  * -v CONT_PATH // a host folder (name is random hash) is automatically generated by docker (at /var/lib/docker/volumes) and mounted to CONT_PATH
  * -v NAME:CONT_PATH // a host folder NAME is automatically generated by docker (at /var/lib/docker/volumes) and mounted to CONT_PATH
  * side note: Mac OS creates a linux VM to store all docker information, so /var/lib/docker/ needs to be accesed via the VM (2:41:20 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c-iBn73dDE)
- docker ps
  * see all running containers
  * -a: see stopped containers too
- docker stop CONT_ID
  * stop a container
- docker start CONT_ID
  * start a container
- docker logs CONT_ID
  * to see the terminal logs of a container (for debugging)
  * -f // to stream the log
- docker exec -it CONT_ID /bin/bash
  * -it means interactive terminal
  * to run bash shell of a container
  * if no bash exist, try /bin/sh instead
- docker network 
  * ls: list docket networks
  * create NET_NAME: create a new network 
- docker-compose -f COMPOSE.yaml up/down
  * up: run containers according to COMPOSE.yaml configuration
  * down: stop and remove all containers created by COMPOSE.yaml and the docker network
- docker rm CONT_ID
  * delete a container
  * need to stop the container first
- docker rmi IMG_ID
  * delete an image
