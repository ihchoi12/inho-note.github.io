# Docker
- tool for running apps in an isolated environment
- similar as running apps in a VM (consistent environment regardless of the externel changes, sandbox different projects, portability)
- but docker is simpler than VM

## Docker File
- text file with a list of steps to perform to create an Image
- define an Image
- ex. configure OS => install some SW => copy project files => ..

## Image
- obtained by building a docker file
- a file consist of OS, software, application code
 

## Container
- obtained by running an Image
- It's a running instance of Image
- It's not a full VM
- A VM gets it's own full OS including kernel via the hypervisor, which uses quite many host resources 
- But container shares the OS with host (but everything on top of that is separated)
- In docker, codes and environments are all wrapped inside a container 
- a container is stopped once the main process is stopped, so we should run one process in one container 

## Volume
- to share or persist data between containers (or host)
- we can mount a local dir as a shared folder (volume) between a container and host
