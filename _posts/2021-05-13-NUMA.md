NUMA is a system that is used in computers with multiple physical CPUs.

# Typical Computer
- One CPU handling most of the computational stuff
- RAM is direcntly connected to the CPU. 
- RAM is not a storage memory, but a working memory of the CPU: CPU can temporarily store things that it's working on 
- RAM's capacity is fairly small (a few GB), but it needs to be incredibly fast (to support incredibly fast CPU's computation)
- BUS is the wires connecting between RAM and CPU (Obviously, BUS is very fast to support the communication between RAM and CPU)

# Computer with 4 CPUs
### How to connect those CPUs to the memory?
- Traditionally, connected all CPUs to a big RAM through one BUS (as if there is one massive CPU)
- Bad idea. Why? Obviouslty, the single BUS is easily saturated
- Here, **NUMA** comes in!

# NUMA: a pair of CPU and RAM connected by a BUS
- On multi-CPU computer, each CPU form a NUMA node, and we simply connect them
- Now, all CPUs can access all momories
- But, accessing it's own memory is faster than accessing another CPU's memory (i.e., Non Uniform)
- Nevertheless, accessing other's RAM is faster than the single BUS saturated by multiple CPUs
