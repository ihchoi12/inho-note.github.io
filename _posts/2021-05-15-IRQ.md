# Operating Systems
- Unlike normal software, OS is event-driven
- That is, OS is executed only whenever an event occurs 
- If a running process (in user space) invokes an event, the OS is executed in kernel space with higher privilege level, 
and return back to the user space when its done  

# Categories of Events
### Hardware Interrupts
- Raised by external HW devices (e.g., NIC when it receives a pkt, or keyboard, mouse, USB etc.)
- These are asynchronous and may occur at any time
### Traps
- i.e., SW interrupts
- Raised by user program to invoke some OS functionalities (e.g., system call)
### Exceptions
- generated automatically by the processor itself as a result of an illegal instruction
- 1) Faults: recoverable errors (e.g., page fault)
- 2) Aborts: difficult to recover (e.g., divide by 0)

# How HW Interrupts are Handled?
### Single Device
- In general, today's processors have a dedicated interrupt pin (called INT)
- For example, a keyboard is connnected through INT, and when a particular key is pressed, an iterrupt is generated to the processor.
- Then, the processor is switched to 'Interrupt Handler Routine', and executes some instructions
- Once the handler is finished, the process is switched back to the original program
### Multiple Devices


##### Physical Layer: modules (implemented in a hardware called PHY-chip) enabling two nodes' communication by 1) Encoding (digital => analouge); 2) Upon receiving analogue, decoding (analouge => digital);
