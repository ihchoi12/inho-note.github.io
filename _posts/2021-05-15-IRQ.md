# Operating Systems
- Unlike normal software, OS is event-driven
- That is, OS is executed only whenever an event occurs 
- If a running process (in user space) invokes an event, the OS is executed in kernel space with higher privilege level, 
and return back to the user space when its done  

# Categories of Events
### Hardware Interrupts
- Raised by external HW devices (e.g., NIC when it receives a pkt, or keyboard, mouse, USB etc.)
- These are asynchronous and may occur at any time
### Traps
- i.e., SW interrupts
- Raised by user program to invoke some OS functionalities (e.g., system call)
### Exceptions
- generated automatically by the processor itself as a result of an illegal instruction
- 1) Faults: recoverable errors (e.g., page fault)
- 2) Aborts: difficult to recover (e.g., divide by 0)

### How two nodes (computers) communicate?
- ALL programs and files are sequences of 0 or 1, so the only thing they need is a way to send and receive 0 or 1
- Looks simple! Why don't we connect them via a electric cable, and assume 0V is 0 and 5V is 1 (i.e., digital signal) [1]?
- It doesn't work.. why? such digital signal have 0 ~ infinite frequency, and no cables can transmit such signal 
- Then, how can we send digital signal? Solution: encoding it into analogue signal\

##### Physical Layer: modules (implemented in a hardware called PHY-chip) enabling two nodes' communication by 1) Encoding (digital => analouge); 2) Upon receiving analogue, decoding (analouge => digital);
