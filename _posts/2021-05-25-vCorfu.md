vCorfu: a cloud-scale object store on a shared log

# How distributed systems achieve consensus?
- Paxos: maintain a distributed shared log
- But, it does NOT scale
- How can we take the nice property of shared log w/o compromising scalability?

# Flash Memory
- Non-volatile memory providing persistence, high throughput and low latency
- 

# Corfu
### Intro
- To use a cluster of flash storage as a single shared log (like a distributed SSD)
- To enable systems work directly over network-attached flash storage
- Why? to reduce overheads and power consumption by eliminating storage servers
- A simple option: combine a high-end server with PCI-e SSD and replicate it for fault-tolerance and scalability of read throughput
- Limitations 
- 1) append throughput is limited by the bandwidth of the single server
- 2) Get bulky, general purpose servers involved between the network and flash can create performance bottleneck and offset the power benefits of flash

### Idea
- Map each position in the shared log to a set of flash pages on different flash units 


### Three entities 
- 1) Control Plane: sequencer (to remove the ordering overheads), Layout (to help clients find where the rest of entities are) 
- 2) Fast Datapath: simple storage units, 
### Corfu Properties
- Sequencer is fast
- Scalable (by adding more storage units)
- Fault Tolerant (via chain replication) 
- Strong Consistency
### How Corfu works?
- Client goes to the layout service to learn where the other entities are (unless the system is reconfigured, client needs to do it just once)
- Client talks to the sequencer and get the seq_num
- Client writes the value at the seq_num location



# Talk Summary
### Background
##### Shared Log
- In the age of cloud, building systems which are scalable and strongly consistent is pretty difficult (i.e., require lots of overheads, complexity)
- Shard Log's goal: providing scalability w/o compromising consistency 
- However, it makes a different set of tradeoffs...

##### How it works?
- Even though writing to a shared log provides strong consistency and high performance,
these systems use SMR to provide strongest level of consistency and concurrency, 
and thus log updates only. 
- For example, instead of writing the new value of a counter, it would write an increment record onto the log
- Consequently, reads become more expensive (why? clients need to read all the updates to figure out the current counter value)




- Goal:
