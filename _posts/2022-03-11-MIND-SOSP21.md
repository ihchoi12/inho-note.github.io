# Resource Disaggregation 
- separate a monolithic server into each type of resources and connect them of multiple servers over network
- provide high resource utilization, modularity, elastic scalability 
- Q. isn't it bad for latency because a single task need to access resources in multiple servers via network?


# memory disaggregation
### why? 
- memories in today's datacenters suffer from low utilization, imbalanced usage, and high energy consumption
- network performance increases => resource disaggregation is more feasible   
### Goal
- performacne of data fetch from memory to CPU over network 
- transparent elasticity (i.e., flexible resource allocation): applications running on a disaggregated system can use any available compute and memory resources 

# MIND
### Goal
- previous studies only manage to achieve only one of the goals 
- create a system that can achieve both high performance and transparent elasticity at the same time 
- by using in-network memory management 

### functionalities
- address translation (where is the data?)
- memory protection (is this access permitted?)
- cache coherence (how to keep data synchronized across CPUs)

### Limitations of programmable switches
- only tens of MB memory on ASIC
- limited number of operations in a pipeline

### design principles
- decouple memory management functionalities
- leverage global view of network 
- exploit network-centric hardware primitives 

### workflow
- a CPU wants to get a data by access to a memory location
- if the data is not cached in the local DRAM, it needs to fetch the data over the network
