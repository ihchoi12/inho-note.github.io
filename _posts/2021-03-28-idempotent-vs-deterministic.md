## Idempotent
- Internal state only changes as a result of the first message (even if duplicates exist)
- f(x) = f(f(x)) (where f is the application of the algorithm for a given input and x is the initial state)

## Deterministic
- Internal state changes is only a function of the sequence of inputs
- Algorithm == f(x) (where x is the initial state)
