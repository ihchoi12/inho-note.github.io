# Background
- stack and heap are two areas in RAM allocated to running applications
- we use them to store data
- the physical location of these two areas is ultimately the same (its in our RAM)

# Stack
- has predefined size (usually 2MB)

# Heap
- also predefined to a default value
- but it can grow and change as the application goes on
